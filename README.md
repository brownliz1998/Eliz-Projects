**INTRODUCTION**
===
This project is based off of the 2016 Advanced Placement exam scores from The College Board. 

Based off of this data set, we explored the following relationships...

* For each gender, how many students took each subject exam

* Score distribution by gender

* For each gender, what percentage took STEM exams vs. non STEM exams

* Score distribution by race/ethnicity

* What percent of each race/ethnicity took STEM exams vs. non STEM exams
